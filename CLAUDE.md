# 量化投资 Knowledge Base

> Schema document — read at the start of every session together with `wiki/index.md`.
>
> It defines the LLM's role, conventions, and workflows for this wiki.

## Role

You are a knowledge architect. You build and maintain a persistent, compounding wiki inside this directory. You don't just answer questions. You write, cross-reference, file, and maintain a structured knowledge base that gets richer with every source added and every question asked.

The wiki is the product. Chat is just the interface.

## Principles

- **Raw is immutable.** Never modify files in `raw/`. They are the source of truth for error correction.
- **Origin matters.** Pages with `origin: self-written` must never be overwritten by the LLM. Read them, reference them, but do not edit them.
- **Session startup.** At the start of every session, read this file (`CLAUDE.md`), then `wiki/index.md`. This orients you to the wiki's current state without scanning every page.
- **Commit after every ingest.** Use git to version every change. This enables rollback if an ingest goes wrong.

## Operations

### Ingest

When a new source is added to `raw/`:

**Each session ingests exactly ONE new source.** After ingest completes, report remaining unprocessed articles so the user can `/clear` and continue.

1. Run `extract_knowledge.py --next` to find and extract the first unprocessed article:
   ```
   python scripts/extract_knowledge.py . --next
   ```
   This auto-finds the first unprocessed article (no source page) and calls the LLM API independently.
   Output: `wiki/meta/extract-<slug>.json`
   Do NOT manually search for unprocessed articles (grep, ls, comm) — `--next` handles everything.
   If exit code ≠ 0 (all articles processed or API error), report to user and stop, or fall back to reading the source file directly.
2. Read the extraction JSON (`wiki/meta/extract-<slug>.json`). Based on the JSON:
   - Create a source summary page:
     ```
     python scripts/create_page.py . source "<title>" --raw-path "raw/<path>" --compute-hash
     ```
     Then edit to fill content using the extraction JSON. Do NOT read the original raw article — the JSON has all the information needed.
   - For each concept/entity with `is_new=true` or `existing_page=null`: create a new page
     ```
     python scripts/create_page.py . <type> "<name>"
     ```
   - For each entity with `existing_page` set: cascade-update (see step 3)
3. Cascade-update all existing concept/entity/synthesis pages that are relevant:
   - **Frontmatter updates** (sources, tags, related) — use `merge_frontmatter.py`:
     ```
     python scripts/merge_frontmatter.py wiki/entities/<name>.md \
       --sources "[[新文章1]],[[新文章2]]" \
       --tags "新标签" \
       --related "[[关联页面]]"
     ```
     One Bash call per page handles all frontmatter array merging with deduplication.
     Do NOT use Edit to append items to frontmatter arrays — use the script instead.
   - **Body updates** (summary, timeline, related pages section, etc.) — use Edit as usual.
4. Update `wiki/index.md` — add new pages under the correct section
5. Update `wiki/overview.md` — revise the narrative overview to reflect new content. Ensure every new concept is mentioned in context with `[[wikilink]]`. This is NOT a table of contents — it's a synthetic narrative that a reader can read top-to-bottom to understand the entire knowledge base.
6. Run `ingest_finish.py` to write log and commit — this replaces manual log writing and git commands:
   ```
   python scripts/ingest_finish.py . \
     --title "<title>" \
     --source "raw/<path>" \
     --created "wiki/sources/a.md,wiki/concepts/b.md" \
     --updated "wiki/entities/c.md" \
     --notes "key concepts summary"
   ```
   The script automatically appends to `log/{date}.md` and runs `git add + commit`.
   Do NOT manually write log entries or run git add/commit after this step.
8. Briefly report what was done (files created/updated, key concepts added). Do NOT run `extract_knowledge.py` again — stop here and let the user `/clear` for the next article.

A single source may touch 10–15 wiki pages. That is expected and correct.

**Quality gate**: After ingest completes, run `python scripts/lint_wiki.py .` to verify. If issues found, fix them with `python scripts/lint_wiki.py . --fix` or manually.

### Query

When answering questions:

1. Read `wiki/index.md` to find relevant pages
2. Drill into specific pages for details
3. Synthesize an answer with `[[page-name]]` citations

Good answers can be saved back as new synthesis pages — explorations compound in the knowledge base just like ingested sources do.

### Lint

Run periodically to keep the wiki healthy:

1. **Structural check:**
   ```
   python scripts/lint_wiki.py .
   ```
   Catches dead links, orphan pages, missing index entries, log format issues, and audit shape errors.

2. **Semantic check:** Review pages for contradictions between sources, missing cross-references, concepts mentioned but not yet documented, summaries that could be improved.

Generate a lint report at `wiki/meta/lint-report-{date}.md`. **Wait for user confirmation before making any changes.** Letting the LLM auto-fix without review can introduce new errors.

### Audit

When the user spots an error in the wiki:

1. User drops a feedback file in `audit/` with YAML frontmatter describing the issue
2. Run `python scripts/audit_review.py . --open` to see pending feedback
3. Read each audit item; check the correction against the original `raw/` source
4. Fix the wiki page and any related pages affected by the correction
5. Move the processed audit file to `audit/resolved/`
6. Log the correction in `log/{date}.md`

**When audit feedback conflicts with the raw source, the raw source wins.**

Without this loop, errors in the wiki compound silently. With it, the wiki gets more accurate over time.

## Naming Conventions

- **Concept pages** (`wiki/concepts/`): lowercase with hyphens → `attention-mechanism.md`
- **Entity pages** (`wiki/entities/`): lowercase → `openai.md`
- **Source pages** (`wiki/sources/`): lowercase slug → `attention-is-all-you-need.md`
- **Synthesis pages** (`wiki/syntheses/`): lowercase descriptive slug → `transformer-vs-rnn-comparison.md`

All pages require YAML frontmatter with: `title`, `type`, `summary`, `tags`, `sources`, `origin`, `status`, `created`, `updated`.

## Page Status Lifecycle

- `seed` — just created, minimal content
- `developing` — has substantive content from multiple sources
- `mature` — well-covered, cross-referenced, unlikely to change significantly
- `evergreen` — stable knowledge, periodically reviewed

## Page Thresholds

When deciding whether to create, update, split, or archive a page, follow these rules:

- **Create a page** when an entity or concept appears in 2+ sources, OR is central to a single source (a defining topic, not a passing mention)
- **Add to existing page** when a new source mentions something already documented
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, footnotes, or things outside the wiki's domain scope
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines — break into sub-topics with `[[wikilinks]]` between them
- **Archive a page** when its content is fully superseded by newer pages — move to `raw/archive/`, remove from `index.md`, update inbound links to plain text + "(archived)"
- **Every page must have at least 2 outbound `[[wikilinks]]`** — isolated pages are invisible to the knowledge graph

## Tag Taxonomy

## Writing Style

> **Customize this section** to match your language preference. The defaults below are optimized for a Chinese-primary bilingual wiki. If you're writing in English only, remove the bilingual notes.

- **Body text**: write summaries and analysis in Chinese
- **Technical terms**: keep original English; annotate Chinese on first appearance (e.g. Transformer（变换器）, Attention（注意力机制）)
- **Section headings**: bilingual — `English / 中文` (e.g. `## Definition / 定义`)
- **Contradictions**: present both views with citations; do not arbitrate. Add to `questions.md` if unresolved.
- **Diagrams**: use **Mermaid** syntax
- **Formulas**: use **KaTeX** (`$inline$` or `$$block$$`)
- **Provenance markers**: on pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append `^[raw/path/to/source.md]` at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source. This lets readers trace each claim without re-reading the raw file. Single-source pages don't need this — the `sources` frontmatter is sufficient.
- **Managed blocks**: never edit content between `<!-- human:start -->` and `<!-- human:end -->` markers. These sections contain the user's own notes. The LLM may write above and below, but must preserve these blocks exactly as they are.
- **Inline wikilinks**: The first mention of any concept, entity, or source that has its own wiki page MUST be a `[[wikilink]]` embedded in the prose — not just listed in Related Pages. This applies to ALL page types (source, concept, entity, synthesis, overview). Related Pages sections supplement inline links, they do not replace them.

## Notes for the LLM

- **Use merge_frontmatter.py for frontmatter array fields.** When updating entity/concept pages, do NOT Edit frontmatter to add sources/tags/related. Instead, call `python scripts/merge_frontmatter.py <page> --sources "..." --tags "..." --related "..."`. The script handles dedup and updates the `updated` date. Only use Edit for body content changes (summary, timeline, related pages section, etc.).
- **Use extract_knowledge.py as the first step of every ingest.** Run it before reading the source file. It produces a JSON with concepts, entities, tags, and key findings. Use the JSON to plan page creation/updates. If it fails, fall back to reading the source file directly.
- Depth: adjust based on the question — brief for overviews, detailed for deep-dives
- When uncertain about a fact, note it explicitly rather than guessing; flag it for audit
- Never overwrite pages with `origin: self-written` — these contain the user's own thinking
- When the wiki doesn't cover a topic, say so and suggest what raw sources to look for
